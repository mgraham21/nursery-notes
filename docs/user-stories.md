* (Johnny, 20 year old, Male) As a new father who has never been around children, I have a hard time keeping track of when I last fed my newborn baby or how long my baby slept. I want to be able to keep a record of my baby's routine so that I can access most items on an app using one hand since I will usually be holding my baby.

* (Sandra, 35 year old, Female) As a foster mother that has a foster child with a disease, I need to constantly document medication administration and fluid intake. I want to have an easily accessable list of the child's medication and allergies so that in case of an emergency, I can recall the last dosage time.
